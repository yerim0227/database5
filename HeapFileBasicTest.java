/**
 * A basic test class for the `HeapFile` file organization. This test performs various operations on a heap file,
 * such as inserting records, deleting records, searching for records by key, and performing range searches.
 * It ensures the correct functionality and integrity of the `HeapFile` implementation, verifying that records
 * are properly managed, retrieved, and manipulated as expected.
